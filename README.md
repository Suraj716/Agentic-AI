# Agentic-AI
This repository showcases the implementation of a multi-agent workflow leveraging MCPs (Modular Control Protocols), LLMs (Large Language Models), and multi-agent coordination using LangChain and LangGraph frameworks.  Note: The codebase has been AI-refactored for improved readability, modularity, and performance.
